# ppcode3 Shared Source Project
## Update
* We are about to ship our first wave of algorithms. (2021/12/4)
## Introduction
ppcode3 is a simulation toolkit to speed up research on coding theory. ppcode3 is expected to:
* be easy to develop
* be easy to use
* provide a bunch of codes to compare their performance
* have acceptable performance

To meet these expectations, ppcode3 is:
* developed with Kotlin to make reading and writing source codes less painful
* highly configurable with config files to enable easy management of experimental setups
* shipped with a bunch of ready-to-use codes and performance measures
* multithread to save more time
## Dependencies
ppcode3 use maven to manage all the dependencies. However, [thesallab.configuration](https://github.com/zhangyin-github/thesallab.configuration) has to be installed manually using maven.
## Examples
To be updated when the first code is shipped.
